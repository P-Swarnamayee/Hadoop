Note: If table is not having primary key then no.of mappers should always be '1' ===> "-m 1"

When multiple mappers are initiated:
* First mapper: Automatically points to the beginning record of first split
* Remaining mapper: Cannot point to beginning of their splits randomly because there is no primary key.
So only sequential reading is allowed from beginning to end of the table.
So only 1 mapper should be initiated (-m 1)

Note: "n mapper tasks" ===> "n output files"
